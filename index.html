        <p>The principle of software development projects, is tied to the selection of the best fitted work methodology of the life cycle project. Succesfull projects are managed well by this methodologies with it's differents strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="header-parag">Here's an overview of the most commonly used software development methodologies.</p>

            <h3>Agile Development Methodology</h3>
            <p>Teams use this methodology to minimize risk (such as bugs,costs, and changes) when adding new functuonality. In agil methods is usual have a steps to reach the results, this include inputs from customers, communicate to the team the tasks (called sprint planning), the sprint is a iterative process made 1 to 4 weeks (includes the design, develop, and test of work), which have a diary sprint meeting to summarize the status of tasks, followed by a review, deploy the finished work and a retrospective sprint to improve performance in next tasks. There are many different forms of the agile development method, including scrum, kanban, crystal, XP, FDD. This methodology involves a decision-making approach in projects in an easier way, thanks to a closer scope to the processes, the team and the tasks for more efficient adaptability.</p>

            <h3>PROS</h3>
            <p>The main benefit is that this methodology allows software to be released in iterations (repetitive and consecutive processes). Iterative releases improve efficiency by allowing teams to find and fix defects and align expectation early on. This increment projects, teams and processes improvement.</p>

            <h3>CONS</h3>
            <p>This method rely on real-time communication, so new users often lack the documentation they need to get up to speed. They require a huge time commitment from users and are labor intensive because developers must fully complete each feature within each iteration for user approval.</p>
